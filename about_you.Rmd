# A Little Survey

Here are just a few questions so I can get to know you and so you can get practice submitting an assignment in Canvas.  For each question, insert your answer underneath. Make sure each answer is at the minimum a complete sentence with correctly spelled words and correct puncuation. 

## A short history of you.  
Where did you attend High School, and did you graduate? Compare english class to math, is one easier for you than the other? Finally which subject did you do the best in? Your answer should have at least two sentences devoted to each question.  
  
### my answer     
I went to Antelope Valley College but I graduate from one more high school in Mexico, called Preparatoria Federal por Cooperacion Lic.Gustavo Diaz Ordaz.English is easier for me even though is not my first language, advanced math classes personally are a nightmare. Biomedical sciences are my favorite that's why I earned awards in Chemistry and I was a excellent student in Anatomy, Hematology, Microbiology, Parasitology,etc.

You also need to have have internet access. How is your connection to the internet where you live?

### my answer
